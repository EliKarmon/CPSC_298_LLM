Note: I didn't recieve an OpenAI key for use in the class, so for this assignment, I used the groq key from the last assignment with LLM. 

I tasked LLM with writing an automated git commit bash script - the script is copy pasted into a .sh script, but I will also copy and paste my input with llm's output below: 

elikarmon@Elis-MacBook-Pro-3 assignments % llm -m groq-llama3 "create a script file to create automated git commit messages"
Here is an example script file in Bash that creates automated Git commit messages based on the files modified, added, or deleted in the commit:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the commit message template
MSG_TEMPLATE="Automated commit: %s (%s) %s"

# Check if there are any modified files
if [ $(git diff --name-only --staged) ]; then
  # Get the list of modified files
  ModifiedFiles=$(git diff --name-only --staged)

  # Loop through each modified file
  for File in $ModifiedFiles; do
    # Get the file extension
    Extension=${File##*.}

    # Determine the type of change (addition, modification, or deletion)
    if [ -f "$File" ]; then
      ChangeType="Modified"
    elif [ -d "$File" ]; then
      ChangeType="Added directory"
    else
      ChangeType="Deleted"
    fi

    # Construct the commit message
    MSG="${MSG_TEMPLATE} $ChangeType $File"

    # Print the commit message
    echo "$MSG"

    # Exit the script
    exit 0
fi

if [ $(git diff --name-only --unstaged) ]; then
  # Get the list of unmodified files
  UnmodifiedFiles=$(git diff --name-only --unstaged)

  # Loop through each unmodified file
  for File in $UnmodifiedFiles; do
    # Get the file extension
    Extension=${File##*.}

    # Determine the type of change (addition, modification, or deletion)
    if [ -f "$File" ]; then
      ChangeType="Modified"
    elif [ -d "$File" ]; then
      ChangeType="Added directory"
    else
      ChangeType="Deleted"
    fi

    # Construct the commit message
    MSG="${MSG_TEMPLATE} $ChangeType $File"

    # Print the commit message
    echo "$MSG"

    # Exit the script
    exit 0
fi

# If no files were modified, print a message
echo "No files modified for commit"

# Exit the script
exit 0
```
Let me explain what this script does:

1. It defines a commit message template using the `MSG_TEMPLATE` variable.
2. It checks if there are any modified files using `git diff --name-only --staged`. If there are, it prints a commit message using the template and the file(s) modified.
3. It checks if there are any unmodified files using `git diff --name-only --unstaged`. If there are, it prints a commit message using the template and the file(s) unmodified.
4. If no files were modified, it prints a message indicating that no files were modified for the commit.

To use this script, save it to a file (e.g., `commit_script.sh`) and make it executable by running `chmod +x commit_script.sh`. Then, you can run the script using `./commit_script.sh` or add it to your Git hooks (e.g., `hooks/commit-msg`). When you run the script, it will print the automated commit message to the console.
